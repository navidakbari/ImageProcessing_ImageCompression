# Image Processing and Image Compression
This project include 2 part.

- [First Part](#First-part)
- [Second Part](#Second-part)
- [How it works?](#How-it-works?)

## First part
In this part we should work on a picture and make it better that we can read car tag.
The picture before change:

## Second part
In this part we use Huffman Coding and Zig-Zag pattern for compressing image.
we do this using below diagram.

## How it works?
For using this project clone or download the source code and for each part goes to its file and run the Matlab program and run it.
